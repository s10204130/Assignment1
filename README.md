# Assignment1

# My Personal Portfolio
This project is part of the Interaction Development module's assignment one. I was tasked to create a personal portfolio site, showcasing my work experience, educational history, skills, interests as well as hobbies. 
The goal of this project as a site owner is to create intrest, to inspire recruiters to know more about me and more compitencies and talents. In doing so, site users would it may bring about prospects for career opportunities. 


# Design Process
When designing this website, i put myself in the shoes of the recruiter to show the relavance and intrest, to want to know more about me as an applicant. Thus, while making this website, i kept in mind the things a recruiter would want to find out about the applicant such as work experience, academic qualifications, relavant skills and even hobbies. By scrolling through my webssite, it would help them get to know me better and hopefully bring about a higher possibility for career opportunities. 

As a site user (recruiter), i would want to find out more about the applicant, thus by visiting this page, i would get to know more about the applicant by reading and browsing activities outside of her resume. 

As a site creator, my main goal is to showcase myself in a way that recruiters would want to give me an opportunity at the job that i am applying for, thus by making this website to showcase more about who i am outside of the resume, it would hopefully give recruiters a better insight to me as a person.
